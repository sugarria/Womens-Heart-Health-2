    <string name="target_hr_activity">The standard heart rate formula (220 - your age) was designed for men.\n\nThis app uses a new formula (206 - 0.88 * your age) that is designed for women to more accurately calculate your target heart rates.\n\n50\%% of this rate is your aerobic threshold.\n\n85\%% of this rate is your anaerobic threshold.</string>
    <string name="totals_activity">METs, or Metabolic Equivalents of Tasks, are a measure of the energy required for a task.\n\nThey are calculated using metabolic rates, which are the amount of energy consumed by your body during tasks. The METs value for a task is obtained by dividing its metabolic rate to a resting rate.\n\nYour target METs for a day = 14.7 - 0.13 * your age
